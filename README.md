## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

ESLint is set up in this project. To keep code clean, always remember to run `yarn run lint` and fix any lint problems before merging into master.
